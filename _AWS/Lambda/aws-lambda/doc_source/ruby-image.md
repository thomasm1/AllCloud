# Deploy Ruby Lambda functions with container images<a name="ruby-image"></a>

You can deploy your Lambda function code as a [container image](images-create.md)\. AWS provides the following resources to help you build a container image for your Ruby function:
+ AWS base images for Lambda

  These base images are preloaded with a language runtime and other components that are required to run the image on Lambda\. AWS provides a Dockerfile for each of the base images to help with building your container image\.
+ Open\-source runtime interface clients

  If you use a community or private enterprise base image, add a runtime interface client to the base image to make it compatible with Lambda\.

## Ruby runtime interface clients<a name="ruby-image-clients"></a>

Install the runtime interface client for Ruby using the RubyGems\.org package manager:

```
gem install aws_lambda_ric
```

For package details, see [Lambda RIC](https://rubygems.org/gems/aws_lambda_ric) on [RubyGems\.org](https://rubygems.org/pages/about)\.

You can also download the [Ruby runtime interface client](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-ruby-runtime-interface-client) from GitHub\.
